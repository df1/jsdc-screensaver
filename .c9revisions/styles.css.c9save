And when\n    the step is changed hide the hint, because I can assume that user already\n    knows how to navigate.\n    \n    To summarize it - hint is shown when the user is on the first step for longer\n    than 5 seconds.\n    \n    The other problem I had was caused by the fact that I wanted the hint to fade\n    in and out. It can be easily achieved by transitioning the opacity property.\n    But that also meant that the hint was always on the screen, even if totally \n    transparent. It covered part of the screen and you couldn't correctly clicked\n    through it.\n    Unfortunately you cannot transition between display `block` and `none` in pure\n    CSS, so I needed a way to not only fade out the hint but also move it out of\n    the screen.\n    \n    I solved this problem by positioning the hint below the bottom of the screen\n    with CSS transform and moving it up to show it. But I also didn't want this move\n    to be visible. I wanted the hint only to fade in and out visually, so I delayed\n    the fade in transition, so it starts when the hint is already in its correct\n    position on the screen.\n    \n    I know, it sounds complicated ... maybe it would be easier with the code?\n*/\n\n.hint {\n    /*\n        We hide the hint until presentation is started and from browsers not supporting\n        impress.js, as they will have a linear scrollable view ...\n    */\n    display: none;\n    \n    /*\n        ... and give it some fixed position and nice styles.\n    */\n    position: fixed;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    bottom: 200px;\n    \n    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\n    color: #EEE;\n    text-align: center;\n    \n    font-size: 50px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    \n    z-index: 100;\n    \n    /*\n        By default we don't want the hint to be visible, so we make it transparent ...\n    */\n    opacity: 0;\n    \n    /*\n        ... and position it below the bottom of the screen (relative to it's fixed position)\n    */\n    -webkit-transform: translateY(400px);\n    -moz-transform:    translateY(400px);\n    -ms-transform:     translateY(400px);\n    -o-transform:      translateY(400px);\n    transform:         translateY(400px);\n\n    /*\n        Now let's imagine that the hint is visible and we want to fade it out and move out\n        of the screen.\n        \n        So we define the transition on the opacity property with 1s duration and another\n        transition on transform property delayed by 1s so it will happen after the fade out\n        on opacity finished.\n        \n        This way user will not see the hint moving down.\n    */\n    -webkit-transition: opacity 1s, -webkit-transform 0.5s 1s;\n    -moz-transition:    opacity 1s,    -moz-transform 0.5s 1s;\n    -ms-transition:     opacity 1s,     -ms-transform 0.5s 1s;\n    -o-transition:      opacity 1s,      -o-transform 0.5s 1s;\n    transition:         opacity 1s,         transform 0.5s 1s;\n}\n\n/*\n    Now we 'enable' the hint when presentation is initialized ...\n*/\n.impress-enabled .hint { display: block }\n\n/*\n    ... and we will show it when the first step (with id 'bored') is active.\n*/\n.impress-on-bored .hint {\n    /*\n        We remove the transparency and position the hint in its default fixed\n        position.\n    */\n    opacity: 1;\n    \n    -webkit-transform: translateY(0px);\n    -moz-transform:    translateY(0px);\n    -ms-transform:     translateY(0px);\n    -o-transform:      translateY(0px);\n    transform:         translateY(0px);\n    \n    /*\n        Now for fade in transition we have the oposite situation from the one\n        above.\n        \n        First after 4.5s delay we animate the transform property to move the hint\n        into its correct position and after that we fade it in with opacity \n        transition.\n    */\n    -webkit-transition: opacity 1s 5s, -webkit-transform 0.5s 4.5s;\n    -moz-transition:    opacity 1s 5s,    -moz-transform 0.5s 4.5s;\n    -ms-transition:     opacity 1s 5s,     -ms-transform 0.5s 4.5s;\n    -o-transition:      opacity 1s 5s,      -o-transform 0.5s 4.5s;\n    transition:         opacity 1s 5s,         transform 0.5s 4.5s;\n}\n\n/*\n    And as the last thing there is a workaround for quite strange bug.\n    It happens a lot in Chrome.
